# w251-accident-detection: Deep Learning at the Edge
## Business Case
**Problem Statement**
* Survival rate dependent on Emergency Response
* Hit-and-run incidents rising with higher fatalities
* More traffic cameras means less attention span
* Automated notifications can assist monitoring
* Improve emergency response time

**Solution:** Build an accident-detection algorithm for surveillance cameras and deploy a prototype on an edge device.
